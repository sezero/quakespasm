<sect> About <p>

<url url="http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net" name="QuakeSpasm">
is a Quake 1 engine based on the SDL port of
<url url="http://www.celephais.net/fitzquake" name="FitzQuake">.
</p><p>
It includes support for 64 bit CPUs and custom music playback, and includes a new
sound driver, some graphical niceities, and numerous bug-fixes and minor improvements.

<sect> Hints <p>

<em> Visit the <url url="http://www.celephais.net/fitzquake" name="FitzQuake Homepage"> for a full run-down of the engine's commands and variables.</em>

<itemize>
<item>To disable some changes, use "<bf>quakespasm -fitz</bf>"

<item>Quakespasm's custom data is stored in "quakespasm.pak". Install this file alongside your id1 directory to enable the custom console background and other minor features.

<item>For different sound drivers use "<bf>SDL_AUDIODRIVER=</bf><em>DRIVER</em><bf> ./quakespasm</bf>"
, where DRIVER may be alsa, dsp, pulse, esd ...

<item><bf>Shift+Escape</bf> draws the Console.
<item>From the console, use <bf>UP</bf> to browse the command line history and
<bf>TAB</bf> to autocomplete command and map names.
<item>There is currently no CD Music volume support. cd_sdl.c needs replacing with cd_linux.c, cd_bsd.c etc..
<item>In windows, alternative CD drives are accessible by "<bf>quakespasm -cddev F</bf>" (for example)

<item>Quakespasm allows loading new games (mods) on the fly with "<bf>game</bf> <em>GAMENAME {-quoth/hipnotic/rogue}</em>"
</itemize>
</p>

<sect1>Music Playback<p>
Quakespasm can play various external music formats, including MP3, OGG and FLAC.
<itemize>
<item>Tracks should be named like "track02.ogg", "track03.ogg" ... (there is no track01) and placed into "Quake/id1/music".
<item>Unix users may need some extra libraries installed: "libmad" or "libmpg123" for MP3, and "libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG.
<item>As of 0.90.0, music is played back at 44100Hz by default with no need to adjust "-sndspeed".
<item>Use the "-noextmusic" option to disable this feature.
<item>See <url url="Quakespasm-Music.txt"> for more details.
</itemize>


<sect> Compiling and Installation<p>
<p>Quakespasm's (optional) custom data is now stored in the file <bf>quakespasm.pak</bf>. This file should be placed alongside your quakespasm binary and <bf>id1</bf> directory.</p>
<p><em>To check-out the latest version of QuakeSpasm, use</em> <bf>svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/quakespasm/code/trunk/quakespasm</bf></p>

<sect1> Linux/Unix <p>
After extracting the source tarball, browse the Makefile and edit the music streaming options, then
<code>
make
cp quakespasm /usr/local/games/quake (for example)
</code>
<newline>
Compile time options include
<itemize>
<item><bf>make DO_USERDIRS=1</bf> to include user directories support
<item><bf>make DEBUG=1</bf> for debugging
<item><bf>make SDL_CONFIG=</bf><em>/PATH/TO/SDL-CONFIG</em> for unusual SDL installations
<item><bf>make USE_SDL2=1</bf> to compile against SDL2 instead of SDL1.2
</itemize>
<p>Streaming music playback requires "libmad" or "libmpg123" for MP3, and "libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG files.
<p>The project can also be built with Codeblocks (project files included).</p>

<sect1> Windows <p>
The QuakeSpasm developers cross-compile windows binaries using <url url="http://www.mingw.org" name="MinGW"> and <url url="http://mingw-w64.sf.net" name="Mingw-w64">.

The project can also be built using Visual Studio 2005 (or newer).</p>

<sect1> Mac OS X <p>
A Quakespasm App (including program launcher and update framework) can be made using the <bf>Xcode</bf> template found in the MacOSX directory.

Alternatively, have a look at <bf>Makefile.darwin</bf> for more instructions on building from a console.
</p>

<sect> Known Bugs <p>
Some versions of Xorg and SDL have brightness issues.
<newline>
Try setting "export SDL_VIDEO_X11_NODIRECTCOLOR=1", or if you have Xorg >= 7.5 and broken brightness,
these patched libSDL binaries may help.

</itemize>
</p>
<p>
OS X has a well known gamma issue where the screen turns dark, but we currently have no fix.
</p>
<p>
The "game" command doesn't execute quake.rc in the new game directory being switched to. This means any custom key bindings in a mod's config.cfg or special settings in a quake.rc won't be loaded. The only workaround is launching the engine with the -game command-line switch instead of using the game console command. Or, after running the game command, you can run "exec quake.rc" by yourself (YMMV).
</p>
<sect> Changes<p>

<sect1> Changes in 0.90.0<p>
<itemize>
<item> Unix/Mac user directories support. Disabled by default, 'make DO_USERDIRS=1' to enable it.
<item> SDL2 support. Disabled by default, 'make USE_SDL2=1' to enable it.
<item> Revised keyboard input code.
<item> Revised/improved the 'game' command, i.e. on-the-fly mod changing. It now accepts an optional second argument for mission packs or quoth support i.e. -hipnotic, -rogue, or -quoth. For example, for WarpSpasm: "game warp -quoth"
<item> Command line: "-game {quoth/hipnotic/rogue}" is now treated the same as -quoth, -hipnotic, or -rogue.
<item> Console speed now resolution-independent.
<item> Disabled gl_zfix, which caused glitches and is undesirable for new maps. Replacement .ent files to fix z-fighting for several id1 maps added to quakespasm.pak.
<item> PF_VarString buffer bumped to 1024, avoids truncated centerprints from the 'In The Shadows' mod.
<item> Support for opengl non-power-of-two-textures extension (disable with command line: "-notexturenpot".)
<item> Support for OpenGL vertex buffer objects (VBO, OpenGL 1.5 or newer) for world and brush models (disable with command line: "-novbo".)
<item> Antialiasing (FSAA) support (command line: -fsaa x, where x can be 0, 2, 4, 8).
<item> Fence textures support.
<item> Dynamic light speedup. Speedup loading of tga and pcx external images.
<item> Brush model drawing speedup.
<item> Support for BSP2 and 2PSB map formats.
<item> Support for Opus, FLAC, and tracker music (S3M, IT, UMX, etc.), as compile-time options.
<item> Music and sfx now mixed at 44100Hz to avoid downsampling music. Low-pass filter applied to the sfx if -sndspeed is 11025 (the default), to preserve the same sound quality as 0.85.9.  New -mixspeed option sets the rate for mixing sfx and music, and output to the OS (default 44100), setting it to 11025 reverts to 0.85.9 behaviour. New snd_filterquality cvar, value can be between 1 (emulate OS X resampler) and 5 (emulate Windows resampler), controls the sound of the low-pass filter.
<item> Better Hor+ field of view (FOV) scaling behavior.
<item> Better cross-map demo playback support.
<item> Fix screenshots when screen width isn't a multiple of 4.
<item> Fix a lighting glitch due to floating point precision.
<item> Fix a looping sounds glitch.
<item> Fix a vulnerability in file extension handling. Tighten path handling safety.
<item> Initialize opengl with 24-bit depth buffer at 32 bpp.
<item> Reset all models upon gamedir changes. (Fixes failures with mods using custom content.)
<item> Fix broken behavior upon gamedir changes if -basedir is specified on the command line.
<item> NET_MAXMESSAGE and MAX_MSGLEN limits bumped to 64000.
<item> MAX_EFRAGS bumped to 4096, and MAX_CHANNELS to 1024.
<item> MAX_ENT_LEAFS bumped from 16 to 32 to work around disappearing or flickering brush models in some situations. Also, if an entity is visible from MAX_ENT_LEAFS or more leafs, we now always send it to the client.
<item> Fix cvar cycle command not working sometimes.
<item> Host_Error upon missing models. (Prevents segmentation faults.)
<item> Change sv_aim default value to 1 (i.e. turn off autoaim)
<item> Add 'prev' and 'next' keywords to the 'cd' command.
<item> Work around a linux cdrom issue (playback might not start for a while after a stop).
<item> Quakespasm content customization moved from engine-embedded into a new optional quakespasm.pak file.
<item> Version bumped to 0.90.0 (because Quakespasm has a decent life of it's own)
<item> Other fixes and clean-ups.
</itemize>
</p>

<sect1> Changes in 0.85.9<p>
<itemize>
<item> Fixes for several undefined behaviors in C code (gcc-4.8 support.)
<item> Implemented Hor+ style field of view (FOV) scaling, useful for widescreen resolutions. Configured by new cvar fov_adapt: set it to 1 and your fov will be scaled automatically according to the resolution. Enabled by default.
<item> Adjusted string buffers for PR_ValueString and friends to fix crashes with excessively long global strings seen in some rude mods.
<item> Toned down warning messages from PF_VarString() a bit.
<item> Fixed Fitzquake's map existence check in changelevel (used to leak file handles which would end up in a Sys_Error() due to consuming all free handles if many maps reside not in pak files.)
<item> Fixes/cleanups in chat mode handling. Client no longer gets stuck in chat mode upon disconnect.
<item> Mouse grab/key_dest fixes and key cleanups.
<item> The "speedkey" now acts as "slowkey" when "always run" is on.
